# Goon

Goon is a fast, convention-over-configuration web framework for Go â€” built to get you from zero to working, deployable app with minimal setup and maximum clarity. It enforces structure, favors simplicity, and helps you ship faster without sacrificing maintainability.

- Brutal simplicity: A tool that just does the job, no fluff.
- Concrete over cleverness: Convention-driven, practical, not theoretical.
- Blunt force: Not afraid to push convention hard.
